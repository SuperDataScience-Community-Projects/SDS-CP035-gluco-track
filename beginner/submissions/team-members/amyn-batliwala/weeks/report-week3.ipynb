    "### 1. Baseline Models Trained\n",
    "- **Logistic Regression**\n",
    "- **Decision Tree**\n",
    "- **Naive Bayes**\n",
    "\n",
    "Each model was trained on the processed training set and evaluated on the validation set.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Experiment Tracking\n",
    "- **MLflow** was used to log metrics for each model, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Validation Metrics\n",
    "For each model, the following metrics were computed on the validation set:\n",
    "- **Accuracy:** Proportion of correct predictions.\n",
    "- **Precision:** Proportion of positive identifications that were actually correct.\n",
    "- **Recall:** Proportion of actual positives that were identified correctly.\n",
    "- **F1-score:** Harmonic mean of precision and recall.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Error Analysis\n",
    "- **Confusion Matrices** were generated for each model to visualize true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.\n",
    "- **Classification Reports** provided detailed breakdowns of precision, recall, and F1-score for each class.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Insights\n",
    "- The results allow comparison of baseline models to identify which performs best on the validation set.\n",
    "- Confusion matrices highlight where models are making errors (e.g., misclassifying diabetic vs. non-diabetic cases).\n",
    "- MLflow tracking enables reproducibility and easy comparison of experiments.\n",
